# DeployAVueProject

This is for the Deploy a Vue Project assignment in CIS-131, in which I had to create and upload an entire Vue application and have a link to it.
This one gave me some trouble, though I'm glad I perservered and pushed through. Making the application, I followed along with the 
Vue CLI video tutorials and the Node.js video tutorials to make the Vue app to have a working project all set and uploaded, which I'm certain now as it needed to be a 
Vue CLI application. Uploading the link to my Github, since there has been issues working with Atom and now the Netlify site listed, when trying to link my Github up to it. 
Although thankfully, I do have my work all in full here, and I'm proud to keep moving forward nearing the end of our semester
